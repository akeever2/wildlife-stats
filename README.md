# BIOL6980  

## Course materials for BIOL6980: Wildlife Statistics and Analysis in Program R  

This is the unofficial course website for the Spring 2022 offering of BIOL6980: Wildlife Statistics and Analysis in Program R at Tennessee Tech University. This website is built using the R package `distill`.  

The goal of using `distill` is to create a central repository for students to access all course materials - lecture slides, lab activities, assignment templates, code, data, etc. A secondary goal is to make those materials freely available to other students and instructors who may find them useful. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, feel free to [contact me](https://ackeeve.netlify.app/contact/).

General course information can be found by clicking on the syllabus and schedule links above. Throughout the semester, I will also post lecture notes and lab activities which can be accessed using the drop down menus. I will attempt to post these as far in advance as possible and no later than the day before class.


## Use of material  

Materials included in this course is purposefully made available to anyone who finds it useful. Users are free to use, adapt, distribute, display, and communicate these materials freely. If you find these materials useful, please let me know, especially if you are using or adapting these materials for teaching. Tracking use of these materials outside of the official course is not only great validation for my effort, it helps me demonstrate "a positive professional reputation in teaching" (which happens to be useful for career advancement).
